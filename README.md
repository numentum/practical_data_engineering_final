# Practical Data Engineering Final Solution

This repo contains the code that we have written during the course, together with some extra comments. Try to use this repo as little as possible: you will learn more if you follow along and implement things on your own. 
Nevertheless, the full solution is here for your reference in case you are stuck somewhere.
